### Some questions to ponder upon
What format is data saved in? (in memory and on disk)
When does it move from memory to disk?
Why can there be only one primary key per table? (?)
How does rolling back a transaction work (?)
How are indexed formatted (?)
When and how does a full table scan work (?)
What format is a prepared statement saved in ?

### Points to note
sqlite has fewer features thatn MySQL or PostgreSQL so easier to code
The entire database is stored in a single file
